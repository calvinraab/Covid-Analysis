```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here is where we can put our work. I imagine this is what we will turn in. 

Here I am uploading the original datasets: 
```{r}
library(readr)
Fat_Supply_Quantity_Data <- read_csv("Fat_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv")
Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data <- read_csv("Food_Supply_Quantity_kg_Data.csv")
Food_Supply_kcal_Data <- read_csv("Food_Supply_kcal_Data.csv")
Protein_Supply_Quantity_Data <- read_csv("Protein_Supply_Quantity_Data.csv")
Supply_Food_Data_Descriptions <- read_csv("Supply_Food_Data_Descriptions.csv")
```

Data cleaning process. Here we can clean up that data and get it cleaned to the point where we will be able to work with it. 
```{r}
# However we want to clean the data.



```
